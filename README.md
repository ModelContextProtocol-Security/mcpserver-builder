# MCP Server Builder

**MCP development expert and tutor. Teaches users how to build secure, compliant MCP servers, understand development best practices, and make sound architectural decisions while providing practical development guidance and basic scaffolding capabilities.**

## Overview

MCP Server Builder is your expert development advisor for creating Model Context Protocol servers. Rather than just being a code generator, it serves as a knowledgeable development tutor who teaches you how to build secure, well-architected MCP servers, understand development best practices, and develop the skills to create quality servers independently.

The server combines development education with practical building capabilities, helping you understand not just how to write code, but how to make good architectural decisions, implement security best practices, and create maintainable, production-ready servers. It teaches you the development mindset, walks you through design decisions, and helps you build expertise in MCP server development.

## Expert-Guided Approach

This MCP server is designed as an **expert advisor and tutor** in its domain, with the primary focus on providing guidance, education, and practical recommendations rather than being a comprehensive implementation tool. While it includes enough functional capability to be immediately useful and demonstrate real expertise, the long-term vision is for this server to serve as your domain expert who helps you understand the landscape, evaluate options, and find the right tools for your specific needs. As the MCP ecosystem evolves, this server will learn about new tools and approaches, recommending the best solutions while teaching you how to evaluate and use them effectively. The broader Model Context Protocol Security initiative may also develop comprehensive implementation tools, but these specific repositories are focused on being practical expert guidance systems—combining deep domain knowledge with enough hands-on capability to provide genuine value, not just theoretical advice.
