# MCP Server Builder

**Development toolkit for creating and modifying MCP servers. Provides scaffolding, templates, and guided workflows to build secure, compliant Model Context Protocol servers with built-in security best practices.**

## Overview

MCP Server Builder is a comprehensive development tool that helps users create new MCP servers or modify existing ones to meet specific requirements. Whether you're building a server for a use case identified by mcpserver-finder, addressing security issues discovered by mcpserver-audit, or creating entirely new functionality, this tool provides guided development workflows with security best practices built-in.

The tool begins by understanding the user's development objectivesâ€”whether creating from scratch, modifying existing servers, fixing security vulnerabilities, or implementing specific features. It then provides appropriate scaffolding, code generation, and validation to ensure the resulting server meets both functional and security requirements.
